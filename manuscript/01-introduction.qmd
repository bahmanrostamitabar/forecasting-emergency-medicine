# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Inability to match the resources with the demand in Emergency Medical Services (EMS) results in an overcrowding care system. This is a serious problem causing challenging situations on patient flow, that ultimately leads to increasing patient's length of stay, higher waiting times, low patient satisfaction, high staff pressure, increasing health care costs and inaccuracy in electronic medical record [@ekstrom2015forecasting; @ROSTAMITABAR20221197]. Demand forecasting in EMS is a critical element that helps to depict various courses of action to avoid the mismatch, which can result in massive savings in terms of patient safety and lives. An accurate forecasting of the daily demand enables planners and decision makers to manage resources to meet anticipated patients, reconfigure units, redeploy staff and vehicles, where necessary. This will have many advantages for patients, staff and the quality of healthcare services provided.

Demand forecasts are typically required at multiple levels of cross-sectional granularities to inform various planning and decision-making processes across the EMS [@hulshof2012taxonomic]. There are some planning process at the national level (more strategic or long-term) such as workforce resource planning and budgeting; sub-national and regional level (tactical or medium-term) such as temporary capacity expansions, resource sharing and staff-shift scheduling; and healtboard, hospital or station level (operational or short-term) such as planning rosters for staff and ambulance deployment. Demand forecasts might be also required at different level for a specific group of interest such as nature of demand (e.g. type of incidents) or demand priority. Moreover, there exists an inherent hierarchical and grouped structure relationships that typically occurs in EMS data. Demand for emergency services at the country level can be disaggregated in a geographical hierarchy into sub-national, regions and healthboards or divided into groups such as nature of incidents or demand priority.

Despite a large number of studies dedicated to forecasting for Emergency Medical Services [@mingliterature2022; @gul2020exhaustive; @ibrahim2016modeling; @wargon2009systematic], the main focus has been on producing independent forecasts at a single level, ignoring the inherent hierarchical or grouped structure relationships of the time series demand. However, forecasting the EMS demand across all hierarchical and grouped levels is paramount for an effective planning and decision making. The hierarchical forecasting approach can not only achieve more accurate forecasts than the independent (base) forecasts, but also creates consistent forecasts [@hyndman2011optimal]. Obtaining consistent forecasts at different levels is important for reliable decision-making to avoid making conflicting decisions. With hierarchical forecasting, plans at any level are based on identical forecasts and therefore can be aligned. Implementing and sustaining improvements in EMS requires alignments and coordination between different stakeholders, without which teams operate in isolation that may lead to conflicts, duplication work, rework, or work that runs counter to overall goals to improve hospital-wide patient flow. Hierarchical forecasting framework can also be used as a tools to improve coordination between teams across the care services at the national, sub-national, regional and hospital levels. To our knowledge, there is not only no research in the EMS forecasting to account for the hierarchical and grouped structure of the system but also in the entire field of forecasting for healthcare management (also referred to as non-clinical healthcare).

In this paper, we address this gap by investigating the application of forecast reconciliation methods in the Emergency Medical Services using the daily time series of verified incidents in the Great Britain from 2015 to 2020. The data has a hierarchical and grouped structures with hierarchies at the national, control (sub-national), healthboard (corresponding to regions) and groups by priority and nature of incidents. We compare the point and probabilistic forecast accuracy of the independent forecasts, bottom-up and optimal combination approaches. We use Exponential smoothing, ARIMA and Poisson regression to generated the independent based forecast followed by applying bottom-up and optimal reconciliation approaches. Forecast performance are assessed by the Root Mean Squared Scaled Error (RMSSE) for point forecasting and the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) for the probabilistic forecast. This paper complies with the principles of reproducibility  [@stodden2013best; @boylan2015reproducibility] and utilising fable package [@fable2022] in R software. Therefore, this study could equally be applied to any healthcare service (e.g. emergency department, primary or social care) subject to the time series demand having a hierarchical and/or grouped structure, which is generally the case in the healthcare sector.

The remainder of this article is structured as follows: In section 2, we provide a brief review of the
literature and discuss its limitation to position our work; in section 3, we present the experiment design describing the dataset, forecasting methods and forecast evaluation metrics. In Section 4, we describe the hierarchical and grouped time series forecasting methods for producing point and probabilistic forecasts. In section 5, we present and discuss our results; in section 7, we summarize
our findings and present ideas for future research.
